**About the Project**
This opens a webpage that is used as a Ping Pong score keeper. Use the "Playing To" drop-down button to select a value. When either player 1 or player 2 
reaches the winning score (the selected value), it should show as green text and the opponent score should show in red. The "Player One" and "Player Two" button
should disable automatically once the game is over. You may start playing a new game by resetting the scores using the "Reset" button. On clicking "Reset", all buttons
should automatically activate again, and the scores reset to 0. 

**Preferred Browser**
For best result, use Google Chrome
